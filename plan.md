# üåç Context: The Hackathon Challenge

This is a **global hackathon** where you're building a web app that addresses **regional groundwater (and water) monitoring and insights** for countries where your team members are based: **Ghana, Kenya, and India**.

The general **problem** you're tackling is:
- **Groundwater levels are changing** over time due to climate, urbanization, and agriculture.
- **Many communities rely heavily** on groundwater, especially in the Global South.
- **Access to regional groundwater data** is either too technical, too sparse, or hard for non-specialists to interpret.

Your **solution**:  
Build a lightweight, **region-specific, visual web app** that makes **groundwater conditions easy to understand** at a glance for decision-makers, students, journalists, or even curious citizens.

# ‚ú® What the MVP Web App Should Do

At its **core**, the app should:

### 1. **Country Selection**
- User sees a **simple dropdown**: "Select a Country" ‚Äî Ghana, Kenya, or India.
- Based on their selection, the app **loads groundwater information and maps** for that country.

### 2. **Map Display**
- **Central Feature**: An interactive map that shows **recent groundwater levels** (or anomalies ‚Äî changes compared to normal) for the selected country.
- The map should **visually** represent areas where groundwater:
  - Is higher than average (shaded green/blue),
  - Is lower than average (shaded yellow/red).

You‚Äôre plotting **groundwater storage anomalies** spatially ‚Äî i.e., **where and how much** groundwater deviates from normal conditions across the country.

### 3. **Groundwater Insights Panel**
Next to the map (or below, depending on screen size), you display:
- **Average Groundwater Change** (for the selected country, latest month).
- **Trend Over Time**: e.g., "Groundwater levels have been decreasing over the past year."
- **Important Warnings or Highlights** (optional): E.g., "Northern Ghana shows significantly declining groundwater."

This makes the app **informative**, not just a pretty map.

# üîç Additional Features to Include (Simple, Useful)

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|:---|:---|
| **Time Selection (Optional)** | Allow user to choose a month/year to see how groundwater changed over time. |
| **Data Download** | Let users download the groundwater data shown (as CSV or image). |
| **Sources/Attribution Section** | Brief note on where the data is from (e.g., GRACE satellites). Builds trust. |
| **Mobile Responsiveness** | Ensure app works on phones ‚Äî especially important for local users in your target countries. |
| **Insight Cards** | Break down groundwater stats by region if possible (e.g., "Western Kenya: 12% decrease"). |

# üìà Why It Fits the Hackathon

- **Problem relevance**: Water security is a massive issue globally, and increasingly urgent.
- **Clear social impact**: Useful for NGOs, local governments, farmers, and researchers.
- **Leverages open data**: Smart use of available scientific datasets.
- **Technical feasibility**: Achievable within the hackathon timeline by simplifying complex data into easy visuals.
- **Team's regional diversity**: Ghana, Kenya, and India showcase a global application of the solution.

**Bonus**: Your app shows that **global satellite science** can be localized for **specific communities** ‚Äî a powerful story for the judges!

# üßπ Granular Step-by-Step Flow for the App Itself

**When someone opens the app:**

1. They see a clean page with a title ("Groundwater Insights") and a dropdown.
2. They select **Ghana** (for example).
3. The map recenters on Ghana and shows:
   - Areas with groundwater increase (colored differently),
   - Areas with groundwater decrease.
4. Next to the map, they see:
   - Average groundwater anomaly in Ghana (e.g., "+2.3 cm above normal").
   - The general trend (e.g., "Stable" or "Decreasing" over past 12 months).
5. They can optionally download the data or read a small paragraph about groundwater health in Ghana.
6. If they switch to Kenya or India, the map and info update instantly.

# üìà What Are You Plotting?

- **Spatial Groundwater Data**:  
  You are plotting data from satellite observations that measure **how much groundwater storage has changed** compared to a long-term normal (anomaly).

- **Visual Intuition**:  
  People should immediately see **"This place is dry"** or **"This place has gained water"** without needing to interpret numbers.

- **Latest Available Month**:  
  To minimize preprocessing, **you‚Äôll only plot the latest available month‚Äôs data** ‚Äî no complex time series animations for MVP.
