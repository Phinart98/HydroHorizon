# Hackathon for the People's Data - Participant Guide

## Welcome, Climate Data Champions!

Thank you for joining the Hackathon for the People's Data. Your participation is crucial in our collective effort to protect and enhance access to vital climate and environmental data.

> Mission Statement: Critical public datasets on climate and the environment are facing unprecedented threats. When these datasets become inaccessible, we lose vital information and the foundation for evidence-based decision-making on critical global challenges. Citizens must take on the role of stewards for these essential public data sources.
> 

This guide will help you understand the challenge tracks, provide resources to get started, and outline what successful solutions might look like.

## Wait, what is a Hackathon?

*This* Hackathon is not about coding. This Hackathon is about hacking away at problems. And an old one at that. Who does data, such as climate data, belong to? How do we make data most useful where and when it is needed? How do we keep data secure through climate events, and administrative changes, and funding challenges? How do we communicate insights quickly and efficiently when needed, for policy decisions, in response to emergency events such as floods and fires? This data *impacts* *everybody* *and therefore everyone can contribute* from data, platform-building, insights, policy, user perspectives. This is your chance to do something!

## üîç Challenge Tracks Overview

We've identified three critical challenge areas where your innovative solutions can make a significant impact. **Remember: The goal is to suggest concrete solutions and build working prototypes within the 24-hour hackathon period.** Focus on creating solutions that demonstrate your concept, even if they're not fully polished.

### üå°Ô∏è Track 1: Climate Data Vault

**Problem Statement**: Climate and weather data is critical for communities preparing for extreme events, yet it remains fragmented across numerous federal agencies, research institutions, and state repositories. During recent disasters like the river flooding in California, affected communities struggled to access comprehensive, localized climate data needed for preparation and response. Technical barriers, inconsistent formats, and dispersed storage locations prevent timely access precisely when communities need this information most.

**Challenge**: Develop a lightweight, resilient platform that aggregates and standardizes public climate and weather data from multiple sources, making it easily searchable and usable for communities preparing for extreme weather events.

**Success Criteria**:

- Solution incorporates at least three public data sources
- Demonstrates how communities can access localized climate risk information even during connectivity disruptions
- Data remains accessible and usable during various disruption scenarios

**Context to Consider**:

- [Environmental coalition works to preserve federal climate data / Public News Service](https://www.publicnewsservice.org/2025-04-03/environmental-justice/environmental-coalition-works-to-preserve-federal-climate-data/a96112-1)
- [TELT Lyon Turin - AI and Open Data to predict climate change in the Alps](https://www.telt.eu/en/alpine-climate-data-challenge-2025/)
- [Federal climate data portals (NOAA, EPA, NASA)](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/federal-climate-tools-pollution-musk-xai-spacex)

### üìä Track 2: Insights Dashboard

**Problem Statement**: Despite abundant public climate and weather data, communities often lack accessible tools to translate this information into practical insights about local climate risks and appropriate adaptation strategies. As extreme weather events become more frequent and severe, communities need user-friendly resources to understand and prepare for local climate threats. Technical barriers prevent many people from accessing and interpreting the public data that could help them prepare.

**Challenge**: Transform complex public climate data into actionable insights for community resilience. Create a web or mobile application that uses public climate/weather datasets to provide location-specific risk assessments and practical adaptation strategies for at least one type of climate threat (flooding, extreme heat, wildfires, etc.)

**Success Criteria**:

- Translates complex climate data into actionable insights for non-technical users
- Provides location-specific risk assessments
- Offers practical adaptation strategies that communities can implement
- User-friendly interface accessible to diverse users

**Context to Consider**:

- [Trump's 'climate' purge deleted a new extreme weather risk tool. We recreated it (Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2025/mar/26/extreme-weather-risk-tool-fema-trump)
- [Scientists Rebuild Climate Risk Map After Government Removal](https://www.winssolutions.org/scientists-rebuild-climate-risk-map/)
- Existing community resilience platforms and toolkits

### üõ°Ô∏è Track 3: Data Vulnerability Index

*Less technical expertise required*

**Problem Statement**: Critical climate and extreme weather datasets face potential threats of removal, defunding, or alteration during administration changes, budget realignments, or policy shifts. There is currently no systematic approach to identify which climate datasets are most critical for extreme weather prediction and preparation, nor which are most vulnerable to removal or defunding.

**Challenge**: Develop a comprehensive "Climate Data Threat Index" methodology that identifies and prioritizes critical datasets related to extreme weather events (flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.) at risk of removal or defunding.

**Success Criteria**:

- Includes clear criteria for assessing dataset criticality based on scientific and public safety factors
- Incorporates vulnerability indicators
- Provides strategic recommendations for preservation
- Methodology can be applied to various types of climate datasets

**Context to Consider**:
